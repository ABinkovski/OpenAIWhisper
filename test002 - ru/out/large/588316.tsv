0	9800	I open fairy tales again, Papuans of those peoples from New Guinea, those who are closely connected with it.
10080	15780	There are many interesting facts about the character of the eagle and about the long flight.
16120	23240	You will find there not difficult to be surprised, about the working girls who get married early,
23240	31300	but there is no joke about the thick starch sea and about the lonely mountain,
31320	36120	about the distant bare reefs and about the myths of what and where,
36200	40380	how they beat the flour with a column and about the lunar escape of Geba,
40560	44980	about the bread with the agave, about the birds of paradise everywhere,
44980	51140	about the walking trees, about the beliefs about the fire and about the burning of the sun from the sky,
51220	52480	even though I have never been there.
53240	55060	I open fairy tales again.
