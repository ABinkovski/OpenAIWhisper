1240	5440	Again I open the fairy tales of the Papuan people,
6100	10620	born in New Guinea, those who are closely related to her.
11160	16260	There are many interesting facts about the character of the eagle and about the long flight.
16560	19880	You will not find it difficult there, which can be surprised,
20360	23320	about the girls working, going to get married early,
23720	26880	only there is no joke, if the husband is a joker.
27580	31380	About the thick starched sea and about the lonely mountains,
32360	36520	about the distant bare reefs and about the myths, what from where,
36680	40840	how they beat the flour to the moons, and about the lunar escape of the geba,
41120	45040	about the bread with agave in the essence, about the birds of paradise everywhere,
45500	51500	about the walking trees, about the beliefs about the fire and about the heat of the sun from the sky,
