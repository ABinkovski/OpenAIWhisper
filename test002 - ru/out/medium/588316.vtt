00:01.240 --> 00:05.440
Again I open the fairy tales of the Papuan people,

00:06.100 --> 00:10.620
born in New Guinea, those who are closely related to her.

00:11.160 --> 00:16.260
There are many interesting facts about the character of the eagle and about the long flight.

00:16.560 --> 00:19.880
You will not find it difficult there, which can be surprised,

00:20.360 --> 00:23.320
about the girls working, going to get married early,

00:23.720 --> 00:26.880
only there is no joke, if the husband is a joker.

00:27.580 --> 00:31.380
About the thick starched sea and about the lonely mountains,

00:32.360 --> 00:36.520
about the distant bare reefs and about the myths, what from where,

00:36.680 --> 00:40.840
how they beat the flour to the moons, and about the lunar escape of the geba,

00:41.120 --> 00:45.040
about the bread with agave in the essence, about the birds of paradise everywhere,

00:45.500 --> 00:51.500
about the walking trees, about the beliefs about the fire and about the heat of the sun from the sky,

00:51.720 --> 00:55.540
let me never have been there, I open the fairy tales again.
