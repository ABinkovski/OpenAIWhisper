00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800
I open fairy tales again, Papuans of those peoples from New Guinea, those who are closely connected with it.

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,780
There are many interesting facts about the character of the eagle and about the long flight.

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:23,240
You will find there not difficult to be surprised, about the working girls who get married early,

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:31,300
but there is no joke about the thick starch sea and about the lonely mountain,

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,120
about the distant bare reefs and about the myths of what and where,

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,380
how they beat the flour with a column and about the lunar escape of Geba,

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,980
about the bread with the agave, about the birds of paradise everywhere,

8
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:51,140
about the walking trees, about the beliefs about the fire and about the burning of the sun from the sky,

9
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,480
even though I have never been there.

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,060
I open fairy tales again.
