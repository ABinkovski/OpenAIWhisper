I open fairy tales again, Papuans of those peoples from New Guinea, those who are closely connected with it.

00:10.080 --> 00:15.780
There are many interesting facts about the character of the eagle and about the long flight.

00:16.120 --> 00:23.240
You will find there not difficult to be surprised, about the working girls who get married early,

00:23.240 --> 00:31.300
but there is no joke about the thick starch sea and about the lonely mountain,

00:31.320 --> 00:36.120
about the distant bare reefs and about the myths of what and where,

00:36.200 --> 00:40.380
how they beat the flour with a column and about the lunar escape of Geba,

00:40.560 --> 00:44.980
about the bread with the agave, about the birds of paradise everywhere,

00:44.980 --> 00:51.140
about the walking trees, about the beliefs about the fire and about the burning of the sun from the sky,

00:51.220 --> 00:52.480
even though I have never been there.

00:53.240 --> 00:55.060
I open fairy tales again.
