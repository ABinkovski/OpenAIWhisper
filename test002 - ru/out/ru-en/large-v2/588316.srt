1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:10,140
Again I open the tales of the Papuan peoples of New Guinea, those who are closely related to it.

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:16,060
There are many interesting facts about the character of Orlin and about the long flight.

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,200
You will find there not difficult, which can be surprised, about the girls who work, who get married early,

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,940
only there it is not a joke, if the husband is a slave.

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,240
About the thick starchy sea and about the lonely grief.

6
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,160
About the distant bare reefs and about the myths, that from where,

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,460
how the flour is crushed by the moon and about the lunar flight of Geba.

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,940
Bread with agave on the essence, in the birds of paradise everywhere,

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,240
about the walking trees, about the beliefs about the fire and about the sun's heat from the sky,

10
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,280
even if I have never been there, I open the tales again.
