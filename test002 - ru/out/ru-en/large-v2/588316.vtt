Again I open the tales of the Papuan peoples of New Guinea, those who are closely related to it.

00:10.660 --> 00:16.060
There are many interesting facts about the character of Orlin and about the long flight.

00:16.500 --> 00:23.200
You will find there not difficult, which can be surprised, about the girls who work, who get married early,

00:23.200 --> 00:26.940
only there it is not a joke, if the husband is a slave.

00:27.660 --> 00:31.240
About the thick starchy sea and about the lonely grief.

00:32.120 --> 00:36.160
About the distant bare reefs and about the myths, that from where,

00:36.640 --> 00:40.460
how the flour is crushed by the moon and about the lunar flight of Geba.

00:40.960 --> 00:44.940
Bread with agave on the essence, in the birds of paradise everywhere,

00:45.520 --> 00:51.240
about the walking trees, about the beliefs about the fire and about the sun's heat from the sky,

00:51.240 --> 00:55.280
even if I have never been there, I open the tales again.
