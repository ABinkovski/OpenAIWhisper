1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,440
Again I open the fairy tales of the Papuan people,

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,620
born in New Guinea, those who are closely related to her.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,260
There are many interesting facts about the character of the eagle and about the long flight.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,880
You will not find it difficult there, which can be surprised,

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,320
about the girls working, going to get married early,

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,880
only there is no joke, if the husband is a joker.

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,380
About the thick starched sea and about the lonely mountains,

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,520
about the distant bare reefs and about the myths, what from where,

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,840
how they beat the flour to the moons, and about the lunar escape of the geba,

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,040
about the bread with agave in the essence, about the birds of paradise everywhere,

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,500
about the walking trees, about the beliefs about the fire and about the heat of the sun from the sky,

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,540
let me never have been there, I open the fairy tales again.
