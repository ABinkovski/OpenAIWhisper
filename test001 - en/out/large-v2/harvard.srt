00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,620
The stale smell of old beer lingers.

00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,180
It takes heat to bring out the odor.

A cold dip restores health and zest.

00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,080
A salt pickle tastes fine with ham.

Tacos al pastor are my favorite.

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,500
A zestful food is the hot cross bun.
