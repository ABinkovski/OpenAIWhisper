00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,000
The stale smell of old beer lingers.

00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,300
It takes heat to bring out the odor.

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,240
A salt pickle tastes fine with ham.

Tacos al pastor are my favorite.

00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,560
A zestful food is the hot cross bun.
