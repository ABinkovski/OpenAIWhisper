00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,640
The stale smell of old beer lingers.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,180
It takes heat to bring out the odor.

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,160
A cold dip restores health and zest.

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,000
A salt pickle tastes fine with ham.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,320
Tacos al pastor are my favorite.

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,420
A zestful food is the hot cross bun.
