00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,960
The stale smell of old beer lingers.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,480
It takes heat to bring out the odor.

00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,620
A cold dip restores health and zest.

00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,320
A salt pickle tastes fine with ham.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,480
Tacos al pastor are my favorite.

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,740
A zestful food is the hot cross bun.
