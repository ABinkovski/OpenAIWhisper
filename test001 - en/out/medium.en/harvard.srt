00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,640
The stale smell of old beer lingers.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,240
It takes heat to bring out the odor.

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,460
A cold dip restores health and zest.

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,100
A salt pickle tastes fine with ham.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,380
Tacos al pastor are my favorite.

00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,500
A zestful food is the hot cross bun.
