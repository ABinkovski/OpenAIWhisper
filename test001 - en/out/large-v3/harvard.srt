00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,520
The stale smell of old beer lingers.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,100
It takes heat to bring out the odor.

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,100
A cold dip restores health and zest.

00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,900
A salt pickle tastes fine with ham.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,260
Tacos al pastor are my favorite.

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,320
A zestful food is the hot cross bun.
