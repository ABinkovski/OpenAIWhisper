00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,500
The stale smell of old beer lingers.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,080
It takes heat to bring out the odor.

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,280
A cold dip restores health and zest.

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,900
A salt pickle tastes fine with ham.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,240
Tacos al pastor are my favorite.

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,380
A zestful food is the hot cross bun.
